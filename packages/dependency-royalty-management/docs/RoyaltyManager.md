# RoyaltyManager

RoyaltyManager contract stores the common royalty recipient so the RoyaltySplitters can read it. it also stores the royalty split for the common royalty RoyaltySplitter so that the EIP2981 Royalty is divided between the creator and the common royalty recipient.

Common recipient gets commonSplit/Total_Total_Base_Points part of the royalty and creator get (Total_Total_Base_Points - commonSplit)/Total_Total_Base_Points part of the royalty.

This contract also stores the EIP2981 RoyaltyBps for the contact's which don't use RoyaltySplitters for royalty distribution.

This contract also deploys the RoyaltySplitters for creators, which are deployed when the called by the NFT contracts. A single RoyaltySplitter would be deployed for a creator and these RoyaltySplitters are deployed through RoyaltyManager so that they could be shared across various NFT contracts to receive royalty for a creator.
