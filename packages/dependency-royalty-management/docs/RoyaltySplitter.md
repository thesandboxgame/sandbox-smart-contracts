# RoyaltySplitter

Implementing a clone-able and configurable royalty splitter. It allows for the distribution of royalties from NFT sales among 2 recipients. First recipient is the creator's wallet and the second recipient is common recipient in the RoyaltyManager contract.

This contract calls the RoyaltyManager contract for the common recipient's address, common recipient's split of the Royalty and creator's split of the royalty. Just the creators wallet address is set here to send the royalty RoyaltySplitter's owner is the RoyaltyManager contract.
