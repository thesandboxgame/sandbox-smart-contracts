# Asset Create Contract Documentation

This document serves as comprehensive documentation for the AssetCreate contract, which is responsible for creating new assets in The Sandbox ecosystem. It outlines the contract's roles, public variables, and functions, providing details on their purposes, parameters, and access controls.

## Roles in the Contract

1. **DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE**: The role with broad administrative permissions, including setting URIs and changing the trusted forwarder.
2. **SPECIAL_MINTER_ROLE**: The special minter role with permission to create special assets like TSB exclusive tokens.

## Public Variables

1. `assetContract`: The address of the asset contract.
2. `catalystContract`: The address of the catalyst contract.
3. `authValidator`: The address of the AuthSuperValidator contract.
4. `creatorNonces`: A public mapping from address to uint16, representing the creator's nonce. The nonce is incremented every time a creator mints a new token.
5. `signatureNonces`: A public mapping from address to uint16, representing the signature's nonce. The nonce is incremented for each signature generated by the address.

## Functions

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize(
    string memory name,
    string memory version,
    address assetContract,
    address catalystContract,
    address authValidator,
    address forwarder,
    address defaultAdmin
) external
```

Initializes the contract with the specified parameters at the time of deployment.

Parameters:

- `name`: The name of the contract.
- `version`: The version of the contract.
- `assetContract`: The address of the asset contract.
- `catalystContract`: The address of the catalyst contract.
- `authValidator`: The address of the AuthSuperValidator contract.
- `forwarder`: The address of the trusted forwarder for meta-transactions.
- `defaultAdmin`: The address that will be granted the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE.

### createAsset

```solidity
function createAsset(
    bytes memory signature,
    uint8 tier,
    uint256 amount,
    bool revealed,
    string calldata metadataHash,
    address creator
) external
```

Creates a new asset and associates it with the provided metadata hash. The asset is minted to the creator's address.

Parameters:

- `signature`: A signature generated by TSB for authentication.
- `tier`: The tier of the asset to mint.
- `amount`: The amount of the asset to mint.
- `revealed`: A boolean indicating whether the asset is revealed or hidden.
- `metadataHash`: The IPFS metadata hash associated with the asset.
- `creator`: The address of the asset creator.

### createMultipleAssets

```solidity
function createMultipleAssets(
    bytes memory signature,
    uint8[] calldata tiers,
    uint256[] calldata amounts,
    bool[] calldata revealed,
    string[] calldata metadataHashes,
    address creator
) external
```

Creates multiple assets at once and associates them with the provided metadata hashes. The assets are minted to the creator's address.

Parameters:

- `signature`: A signature generated by TSB for authentication.
- `tiers`: An array containing the tiers of the assets to mint.
- `amounts`: An array containing the amount of each asset to mint.
- `revealed`: An array of booleans indicating whether each asset is revealed or hidden.
- `metadataHashes`: An array containing the IPFS metadata hashes associated with the assets.
- `creator`: The address of the asset creator.

### createSpecialAsset

```solidity
function createSpecialAsset(
    bytes memory signature,
    uint8 tier,
    uint256 amount,
    bool revealed,
    string calldata metadataHash,
    address creator
) external onlyRole(SPECIAL_MINTER_ROLE)
```

Creates a special asset (e.g., TSB exclusive tokens) and associates it with the provided metadata hash. This function can only be called by the address with the SPECIAL_MINTER_ROLE.

Parameters:

- `signature`: A signature generated by TSB for authentication.
- `tier`: The tier of the asset to mint.
- `amount`: The amount of the asset to mint.
- `revealed`: A boolean indicating whether the asset is revealed or hidden.
- `metadataHash`: The IPFS metadata hash associated with the asset.
- `creator`: The address of the asset creator.

### getAssetContract

```solidity
function getAssetContract() external view returns (address)
```

Returns the address of the asset contract.

### getCatalystContract

```solidity
function getCatalystContract() external view returns (address)
```

Returns the address of the catalyst contract.

### getAuthValidator

```solidity
function getAuthValidator() external view returns (address)
```

Returns the address of the AuthSuperValidator contract.

### setTrustedForwarder

```solidity
function setTrustedForwarder(address trustedForwarder) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
```

Sets a new trusted forwarder for meta-transactions. This function is limited to addresses with the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE.

Parameters:

- `trustedForwarder`: The new trusted forwarder address.

## Internal Functions

### \_hashMint

```solidity
function _hashMint(
    address creator,
    uint16 nonce,
    uint8 tier,
    uint256 amount,
    bool revealed,
    string calldata metadataHash
) internal view returns (bytes32 digest)
```

Creates a hash of the mint data for signature verification.

Parameters:

- `creator`: The address of the creator.
- `nonce`: The creator's nonce for the mint operation.
- `tier`: The tier of the asset to mint.
- `amount`: The amount of the asset to mint.
- `revealed`: A boolean indicating whether the asset is revealed or hidden.
- `metadataHash`: The IPFS metadata hash associated with the asset.

Returns:

- `digest`: The hash of the mint data.

### \_hashBatchMint

```solidity
function _hashBatchMint(
    address creator,
    uint16 nonce,
    uint8[] calldata tiers,
    uint256[] calldata amounts,
    bool[] calldata revealed,
    string[] calldata metadataHashes
) internal view returns (bytes32 digest)
```
