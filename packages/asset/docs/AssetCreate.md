# Asset Create Contract Documentation

This document serves as comprehensive documentation for the AssetCreate
contract, which is responsible for creating new assets in The Sandbox ecosystem.
It outlines the contract's roles, public variables, and functions, providing
details on their purposes, parameters, and access controls.

## Roles in the Contract

1. **DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE**: The role with broad administrative permissions,
   including setting URIs and changing the trusted forwarder.
2. **SPECIAL_MINTER_ROLE**: The special minter role with permission to create
   special assets like TSB exclusive tokens.
3. **PAUSER_ROLE**: The role with permission to pause the contract.

## Public Variables

1. `assetContract`: The address of the asset contract.
2. `catalystContract`: The address of the catalyst contract.
3. `authValidator`: The address of the AuthSuperValidator contract.
4. `creatorNonces`: A public mapping from address to uint16, representing the
   creator's nonce. The nonce is incremented every time a creator mints a new
   token.
5. `signatureNonces`: A public mapping from address to uint16, representing the
   signature's nonce. The nonce is incremented for each signature generated by
   the address.
6. `lazyMintFeeInBps`: The fee charged for lazy minting, represented in BPS.
7. `lazyMintFeeReceiver`: The address that receives the lazy minting fee.
8. `availableToMint`: A mapping from uint256 to uint256, representing the amount
   of assets available to lazy mint for given tokenId.

## Lazy Minting Functions

Lazy minting allows creators to list the assets for sale without minting them in
advance. The assets are minted only when a buyer purchases them.

Important notes

- Users should be able to mint assets based on voxel models listed by the
  creators. Note: the asset cannot have been minted already using regular
  minting.
- The unit price is specified by the creator off-chain and is passed as a
  parameter to the lazy minting function.
- To lazy mint users need to either have the required catalysts in their wallet
  or purchase them in the process of minting.
- The ExchangeMatch param in the lazy mint functions will be populated by the
  backend.
- The ExchangeMatch param should be set to empty array if the user is not
  purchasing the catalysts in the process of minting.
- The creator can specify the maximum supply of the asset.
- The creator can specify the payment token for the asset. (initially only SAND)
- A fee may be deducted from the creator's fee for lazy minting operations.
- Catalysts are burned in the process of minting.

The following functions are used for lazy minting:

### lazyCreateAsset

```solidity
function lazyCreateAsset(
  address from,
  bytes memory signature,
  LazyMintData calldata mintData,
  ExchangeMatch[] calldata matchedOrders

metadata hash. The asset is minted to the callers's address.
