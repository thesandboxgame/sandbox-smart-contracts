# Your First Pull Request

We are using feature branches to host the code of an upcoming feature. All feature branches start with "feat/"
prefix, each feature branch is intended for a single purpose.
The following branches will reject direct pushes:

- master branch
- "feat/" prefixed branches

So, in order to commit your changes to master you will have to

- git checkout master
- git checkout -b feat/exampleFeature
- git push --set-upstream origin feat/exampleFeature
- git checkout -b exampleFeature
- git push --set-upstream origin exampleFeature

Now you can write your code and push your changes to the exampleFeature branch, once your'e done you need to open
a pull request from exampleFeature to feat/exampleFeature, and then another pull request from feat/exampleFeature to master.
