# <PACKAGE>

_Include a high level description of your package here_

This example project is based on the template generated by hardhat when run in
an empty directory.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample
contract, a sample test fixture for that contract, and tests.

## Creating a new package

You can copy-paste this example package:
`cp -a packages/example-hardhat packages/<package>`

## Running the project locally

Install dependencies with `yarn`

Testing: Use `yarn test` inside `packages/<package>` to run tests locally inside
this package

For testing from root (with workspace feature) use:
`yarn workspace @sandbox-smart-contracts/<package> test`

Coverage: Run `yarn coverage`

Formatting: Run `yarn prettier` to check and `yarn prettier:fix` to fix
formatting errors

Linting: Run `yarn lint` to check and `yarn lint:fix` to fix static analysis
errors

## Package structure and minimum standards

#### A NOTE ON DEPENDENCIES

1. Add whatever dependencies you like inside your package; this template is for
   hardhat usage. OpenZeppelin contracts are highly recommended and should be
   installed as a dev dependency
2. For most Pull Requests there should be minimum changes to `yarn.lock` at root
   level
3. Changes to root-level dependencies are permissible, however they should not
   be downgraded
4. Take care to run `yarn` before pushing your changes
5. You shouldn't need to install dotenv since you won't be deploying inside this
   package (see below)

#### UNIT TESTING

1. Unit tests are to be added in `packages/<package>/test`
2. Coverage must meet minimum requirements for CI to pass
3. `getSigners` return an array of addresses, the first one is the default
   `deployer` for contracts, under no circumstances should tests be written as
   `deployer`
4. It's permissible to create mock contracts at
   `packages/<package>/contracts/mock` e.g. for third-party contracts
5. Tests must not rely on any deploy scripts from the `deploy` package; your
   contracts must be deployed inside the test fixture. See `test/fixtures.ts`

# Deployment

Each package must unit-test the contracts by running everything inside the
`hardhat node`. Deployment to "real" networks, configuration of our environment
and integration tests must be done inside the `deploy` package.

The `deploy` package only imports `.sol` files. The idea is to recompile
everything inside it and manage the entire deploy strategy from one place.

1. Your deploy scripts should not be included inside `packages/<package>`:
   deploy scripts live inside `packages/deploy/`
2. The `deploy` package doesn't use the hardhat config file from the specific
   package. Instead, it uses `packages/deploy/hardhat.config.ts`
3. You will need to review `packages/deploy/hardhat.config.ts` and update it as
   needed for any new namedAccounts you added to your package
4. When it comes to deploy time, it is preferred to include deploy scripts and
   end-to-end tests as a separate PR
5. The named accounts inside the `deploy` package must use the "real-life"
   values
6. Refer to the readme at `packages/deploy` to learn more about importing your
   package

#### INTEGRATION TESTING

1. End-to-end tests live at `packages/deploy/`
2. You must add end-to-end tests ahead of deploying your package. Importantly,
   these tests should verify deployment and initialization configuration

# Release

We use release-it for versioning and package publishing.

To install it, run:

```shell
yarn add -D @release-it/keep-a-changelog release-it
```

The configuration is done in the `package.json` file.

Here is how it should be set up:

Add the following line to the scripts section:

```json
"scripts": {
    "release": "release-it"
  },
```

```json
 "release-it": {
        "git": {
            "commitMessage": "chore: @sandbox-smart-contracts/marketplace release v${version}",
            "tagAnnotation": "@sandbox-smart-contracts/marketplace release v${version}",
            "tagName": "@sandbox-smart-contracts/marketplace@v${version}"
        },
        "plugins": {
            "@release-it/keep-a-changelog": {}
        },
        "hooks": {
            "before:init": [
                "yarn lint",
                "yarn test"
            ]
        }
    },
```

Steps to create a new release:

1. Add the changes to the CHANGELOG.md file, under the "Unreleased" tag.
2. If necessary, update the package.json file with the release-it configuration
   and the release script.
3. Commit all changes.
4. Run `yarn release â€“dry-run` to preview the release without making any actual
   changes.
5. Execute `yarn release` to create the release.
