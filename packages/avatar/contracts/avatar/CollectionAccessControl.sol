/**
 * @title CollectionAccessControl
 * @author qed.team x The Sandbox
 * @notice Access control functionality for avatar collections.
 *
 * We wanted an access control functionality that:
 *   - has owner
 *   - 2 step owner transfer
 *   - allows roles
 *   - only owner can add users to roles
 *   - transferring owner does not break the above invariants
 *
 *   Some functionality was taken directly from Ownable2StepUpgradeable:
 *   - exactly as they were:
 *       - _pendingOwner variable
 *       - OwnershipTransferStarted event
 *       - pendingOwner
 *       - transferOwnership
 *       - _transferOwnership
 *   - slightly modified
 *       - acceptOwnership
 *           - to also transfer roles before changing ownership
 *
 *   We could not inherit Ownable2StepUpgradeable directly because:
 *   - Ownable2StepUpgradeable.acceptOwnership() is not declared virtual
