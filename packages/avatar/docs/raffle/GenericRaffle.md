# Audience

Documentation is oriented for auditors, internal developers and external developer contributors.


# Description

Writing a generic raffle Smart Contract with minimal ERC721 features / using an existing trustworthy baseline to minimize the risks as we don't plan on auditing the smart contract for each collection launch when possible. 

The regular raffle flow includes following phases:
- whitelist sale
- public sale
- reveal

Deployment:
- Write smart contract and deployment scripts
- Deploy to testnet (Mumbai)
- Setup on OpenSea (testnet)
- Provide deployment instructions for Polygon
- Provide setup instructions for opensea (Polygon)


Collection made with this and released by Sandbox are under [THE SANDBOX PREMIUM NFT TERMS OF USE](https://www.sandbox.game/en/premium-nft-terms-of-use/) and commercial intent.

The contract is [OpenSea royalty compliant ](https://thesandboxgame.notion.site/Sandbox-s-OpenSea-Operator-Filter-Registry-Implementation-3338f625dc4b4a4b9f07f925d680842d) subsequently, all extending contracts are also compliant.

# Functions

Contract functions should respect [order-of-functions solidity style guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/style-guide.html#order-of-functions)

----

```Solidity
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```
* contract constructor
* mitigates a possible Implementation contract takeover, as indicate by https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#initializing_the_implementation_contract

----

```Solidity
function __GenericRaffle_init(
    string memory baseURI,
    string memory _name,
    string memory _symbol,
    address payable _sandOwner,
    address _signAddress,
    address _trustedForwarder,
    address _registry,
    address _operatorFiltererSubscription,
    bool _operatorFiltererSubscriptionSubscribe,
    uint256 _maxSupply
) internal onlyInitializing
```

 * initialization function in accordance with the upgradable pattern
 * calls all the init functions from the base classes. Emits `ContractInitialized` event
 * `baseURI`: an URI that will be used as the base for token URI
 * `_name`: name of the ERC721 token
 * `_symbol`: token symbol of the ERC721 token
 * `_sandOwner`: address belonging to SAND token owner
 * `_signAddress`: signer address that is allowed to mint
 * `_trustedForwarder`: trusted forwarder address
 * `_registry`: filter registry to which to register with. For blocking operators that do not respect royalties
 * `_operatorFiltererSubscription`: subscription address to use as a template for
 * `_operatorFiltererSubscriptionSubscribe`: if to subscribe tot the operatorFiltererSubscription address or just copy entries from it
 * `_maxSupply`: max supply of tokens to be allowed to be minted per contract
----

```Solidity
function setupWave(
    uint256 _waveMaxTokens,
    uint256 _waveMaxTokensToBuy,
    uint256 _waveSingleTokenPrice
) external onlyOwner
```

 * function to setup wave parameters. A wave is defined as a combination of allowed number tokens to be minted in total, per wallet and minting price
 * emits `WaveSetup` event
 * `_waveMaxTokens`: the allowed number of tokens to be minted in this wave (cumulative by all minting wallets)
 * `_waveMaxTokensToBuy`: max tokens to buy, per wallet in a given wave
 * `_waveSingleTokenPrice`: the price to mint a token in a given wave. In SAND wei

*Other observation*

- `mapping(address => uint256) internal waveOwnerToClaimedCounts` - should be reset with each wave start, keeps track of how many tokens were claimed in a wave by a particular wallet
- The operation should fail unless the sale wave is not paused
- The operation should fail if `waveMaxTokens` is larger than the available supply
- Should reset `waveOwnerToClaimedCounts`

----
```Solidity
function mint(
    address _wallet,
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 _signatureId,
    bytes memory _signature
) external nonReentrant
```
 * token minting function. Price is set by wave and is paid in SAND tokens
 * `_wallet`: minting wallet
 * `_amount`: number of token to mint
 * `_signatureId`: signing signature ID
 * `_signature`: signing signature value

*Other observations*
- Custom mint operation similar to [Cyberkonz VX](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7ea3cca10668b8346aec0bf1844a49e995527c8b#code) - with fixed price plus limit check on the amount of tokens to mint
- The amount of tokens is randomly chosen out of the remaining pool of tokens
- Supports other Tokens for minting (we are using SAND)
- Should fail if:
  - `paused == true`
  - the wave max number of tokens limit has been reached or if the total number of tokens in collection has been reached
  - the amount is bigger than `waveMaxTokensToBuy - waveOwnerToClaimedCounts[wallet]`
  - the price paid is not equal to the `amount * waveSingleTokenPrice`

----
```Solidity
function toggleSale() external onlyOwner
```
 * pause or unpause the contract. Emits the `SaleToggled` event

----
```Solidity
function personalize(
    uint256 _signatureId,
    bytes memory _signature,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    uint256 _personalizationMask
) external
```

 * personalize token traits
 * after checks, it is reduced to `personalizationTraits[_tokenId] = _personalizationMask`; emits `Personalized` event
 * `_signatureId`: the ID of the provided signature
 * `_signature`: signing signature
 * `_tokenId`: what token to personalize
 * `_personalizationMask`: a mask where each bit has a custom meaning in-game

*Other observations*
- Personalization adds an extra phase for tweaking a few metadata fields before reveal
- `personalize` stores into a `map(tokenId x bitmap personalizationMask)` the personalization information, if the wallet calling the operation is the owner of the tokenId. 
- Signature is calculated similar to the current mint operation signature and includes the rest of the method parameters (walletId, tokenId, personalizationMask). 
- This operation emita a custom Event that we listen for from the backend side.
- for calculating the bitmap personalization mask
  - The formula/algorithm is specifically tweaked for the collectionâ€™s personalizable traits.
  - In a `256 uint` there can be a maximum of 32 traits personalized each with max `2^8=256` values.
  - The trait order is important to be locked, we can choose an alphabetic sorting of the traits.
- **This feature is not present/supported in most newly created Sandbox NFT collections**
